# Cookie Clicker 3DS
A short Cookie Clicker like app based on Kaisogen's CookieCollector built using devkitPro and made in C.

##Instalation
Download the latest compiled version here:

Then, make sure drag the Cookie Clicker folder in your 3ds folder.

Your directory tree should look like this
* sdmc
	* 3ds
		* Cookie Clicker 3DS
			* Cookie Clicker 3DS.3dsx
			* Cookie Clicker 3DS.smdh

If you want to build the application, then just use the `make` command on your shell.

##Instructions
Use the left and rigth D-Pad keys to move the cursor around  
Press A to select an option (The only ones that don't do anything are the "Cookies!" and the "Select" buttons)  
When on the shop, hover over the "Select" button and use the up and down D-Pad keys to choose between the upgrades  
After choosing an upgrade, select the "Upgrade!" button to buy one. If the button is displayed in red, that means you can't buy the upgrade
To earn cookies, tap on the "Cookie" like figure on the bottom screen (The "Cookies!" was going to be the only way of getting cookies, but then I though it would be too simple)
